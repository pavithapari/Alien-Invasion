# Alien Invasion 🚀👽

## Overview
I've developed a classic space shooter game using Python and Pygame. This is my first project ever,and I've been working on it for a month with guidance 
from the 'Python Crash Course' book, but I've significantly improved it on my own. Used pygame module for game mechanics and tkinter module for GUI interaction.

- 👽 Waves of invading aliens
- 🔫 Shooting mechanics

## 🕹️How to Play
- ⬆️ Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship.
- ⌨️ Press the spacebar to shoot lasers.
- 🪙 Avoid colliding with enemies and shoot them to earn points.
- #You can also run the game using the executable I have created. Simply double-click on the executable file to start the game.
